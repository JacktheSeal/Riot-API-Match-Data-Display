# Riot-API-Match-Data-Display
Displays match data for recent League of Legends matches, can be modified to include more data or expanded on to do more analytics off of data.
This was a very enjoyable project for getting to know the Riot API, relearning Python, as well as learning how to utilize jq and stack overflow better. Its very likely that I will expand this over summer, I had a lot of fun making it. Initially I was going to do it on a website, but then I realized that was a little bit too much work for me to handle. It was definitely challenging, especially trying to figure out why some of my http calls just weren't working occasionally. I spent at least an hour before realizing that you cant have two querys with a ? back to back, instead you need and & symbol between them. I had errors that were pointing other places, which just completely confused me. Either way, I'm definitely going to keep building up this project over the summer, I had a lot of fun. I'm not sure if I'll put it on a website or not, but it was a lot of fun exploring how to use an API, refreshing my memory of python, and learning how to read and parse through json/dictionary files. Thanks! :)
