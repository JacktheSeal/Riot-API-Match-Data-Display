# Riot-API-Match-Data-Display
Displays match data for recent League of Legends matches, can be modified to include more data or expanded on to do more analytics off of data.
This was a very enjoyable project for getting to know the Riot API, relearning Python, as well as learning how to utilize jq and stack overflow better. Its very likely that I will expand this over summer, I had a lot of fun making it.
